<div class="grid cards" style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;" markdown>

-   __🔁 Two-Way Bus Communication__
    
    Bi-directional UART protocol with baud rates up to 1 Mbps, supporting fast control commands and feedback data such as position and other operating status.

-   __🛡️ Complete Protection & Smart Power Limiting__

    Built-in safeguards for temperature, voltage, stall, power, and current, with automatic power limiting to keep operation within a safe range.

-   __🧭 Advanced Modes & Stop Behaviors__
    
    - Single-Turn: ±180° range for standard rotary joints
    - Multi-Turn: ±368,640° (1,024turns) range, with multi-turn count saved after power-off.
    - Damping Mode: controlled resistance for smooth, compliant motion
    - 3 Stop Modes: Free, Lock, and Damp for different holding/release needs

-   __🎛️ Rich Motion Commands & Profiles__
    
    Configure speed, time, and power per application, with sync/async command options and built-in trapezoidal accel/decel profiles for smooth motion and customizable ramp intervals.

-   __📍 Custom Home Position__
    
    A 12-bit absolute position encoder (4,096 steps) lets you define any point as the home position, simplifying assembly, reducing software offset adjustments, and improving position control accuracy.

-   __🔗 Unified Ecosystem & Daisy-Chain Ready__

    All servos share the same protocol for high compatibility, allowing different models to be daisy-chained on the same bus. Within each series, the housing and mounting hole patterns are standardized for easy swaps and consistent mechanical integration.
